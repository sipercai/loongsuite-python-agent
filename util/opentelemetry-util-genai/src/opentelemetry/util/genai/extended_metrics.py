"""
Extended metrics recorder for GenAI invocations.

This module provides LoongSuite GenAI metrics recording following ARMS semantic conventions.
It supports multiple GenAI invocation types: chat, generate_content, embedding, execute_tool, invoke_agent,
create_agent, retrieve, and rerank.

This is just an empty implementation for now, which is a placeholder for enterprise implementation.
