"""Wrapper classes for AgentScope instrumentation.

Concurrency
-----------
The instrumentation supports concurrent ``await agent(...)`` calls on the
**same** ``AgentBase`` instance (e.g. TUI multi-tab, ``asyncio.gather``,
ASGI singletons). Per-call telemetry state is isolated through Python
``contextvars`` so that each asyncio task / thread observes its own
``_ReactStepState``; sibling concurrent invocations on the same agent never
clobber each other's react-step span, round counter or pending acting count.

Two pieces of shared state are kept off the instance:

1. ``_REACT_STATE`` (``ContextVar[_ReactStepState | None]``) holds the
   per-call state. ReAct hooks read it via ``_REACT_STATE.get()`` and
   no-op when the slot is ``None`` (i.e. the hook fired in a context that
   did not opt into instrumentation). The state is never written to
   ``agent`` attributes.

2. ``_REACT_HOOK_REGISTRY`` is a process-global
   ``WeakKeyDictionary[agent -> ref count]`` map guarded by
   ``_REACT_HOOK_REGISTRY_LOCK``.  Using agent objects as keys (rather
   than ``id(agent)``) avoids stale entries when CPython recycles memory
   addresses; weak references let the entry be collected automatically if
   the agent is garbage-collected without a paired release.  The first
   concurrent call on an agent registers four hooks under the fixed name
   ``_REACT_HOOK_NAME``; subsequent concurrent calls only bump the ref
   count. Hooks are removed only after the **last** outstanding call on
   that agent unwinds. This is required because AgentScope's hook
   registry is per-instance, and we must avoid both (a) registering the
   same hook twice (which would double-fire ``_reasoning`` callbacks) and
   (b) removing hooks while a sibling concurrent call still depends on
   them.

Stacked ``ChatModelBase`` / ``AgentBase`` implementations (e.g. proxies where
each layer subclasses the base and ``__call__`` forwards to an inner model or
agent) share one logical invocation. A ``contextvars`` depth counter ensures
only the outermost ``__call__`` emits LLM / ``invoke_agent`` spans; inner
layers call through without duplicating telemetry.
