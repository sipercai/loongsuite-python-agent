## Unreleased

### Added

- Initial DeepAgents instrumentation that marks `create_deep_agent` graphs so
  LangChain instrumentation emits an `AGENT` span for the DeepAgents root.
- DeepAgents skill-load telemetry: when an agent reads a registered skill's
  top-level `SKILL.md` through the built-in `read_file` tool, the tool span
  carries `gen_ai.skill.name`, `gen_ai.skill.id`,
  `gen_ai.skill.description`, and `gen_ai.skill.version`.
