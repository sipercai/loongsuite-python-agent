## Unreleased

## Version 0.6.0 (2026-06-03)

### Removed

- Drop Agno 1.x support and require Agno 2.x public `Agent.run`/`Agent.arun`
  APIs. Users that still depend on Agno 1.x should pin
  `loongsuite-instrumentation-agno < 0.6`.

### Changed

- Align message content capture with `opentelemetry-util-genai` controls such as
  `OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_GENAI_CAPTURE_MESSAGE_CONTENT=SPAN_ONLY`.
- Migrate Agno instrumentation to Agno 2.x public `Agent.run`/`Agent.arun`
  APIs and `opentelemetry-util-genai` `ExtendedTelemetryHandler`.
- Emit standardized AGENT, LLM, and TOOL GenAI spans for agent runs, model
  calls, streaming calls, async streaming calls, and function executions.

### Added

- Add a DashScope smoke example that exercises non-streaming, streaming, and
  concurrent Agno calls.
- Add local test requirements for the Agno LoongSuite tox environment.
