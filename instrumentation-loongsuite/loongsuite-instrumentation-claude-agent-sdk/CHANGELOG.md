# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Added

- Capture `gen_ai.skill.name`, `gen_ai.skill.id`, `gen_ai.skill.description`
  and `gen_ai.skill.version` on the `execute_tool` span of the built-in
  `Skill` tool. Skill metadata is read best-effort from the project-level
  `SKILL.md` frontmatter (located via `SystemMessage.data.cwd`); `skill.id`
  is reported as `claude:project:<skill-name>`. Metadata read failures never
  affect the SDK call.

### Fixed

- Capture Claude Agent SDK session IDs on agent, LLM, and tool spans, and
  preserve active caller context so SDK traces attach to existing caller spans
  instead of being forced to independent roots.
